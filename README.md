## Kanso.js support for the Stripe API and webhooks

`stripe_kanso` is a [Kanso] Couch app to work with the Stripe payments system, in particular, the webhooks events.

Stripe webhooks *do* work directly on a CouchDB database URL; however the `_update` function in this project makes things a bit nicer.
